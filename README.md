# VideoSprites

Creates thumbnail sprite images and a WebVTT metadata file that can be used within several HTML5 video players to show preview thumbnails when hovering over the video time rail.

The initial version [video-sprites](https://github.com/jronallo/video-sprites) was written during an [AMIA](http://www.amianet.org/) hack day by Ashley Blewer, Jay Brown, Jason Ronallo, and Nicholas Zoss. This version improves on the CLI and allows it to be used as a module in other projects.

## Requirements

- ffmpeg
- Imagemagick (convert and montage)

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'video_sprites'
```

And then execute:

`$ bundle`

Or install it yourself as:

`$ gem install video_sprites`

## Usage

### Use in Command Line
See usage with: `videosprites help process`

Try it out with the defaults on one of the test videos in this repository under test/videos:

`videosprites process test/videos/GibraltarVotesToRemainBritish1967-51sec.mp4 tmp/gibraltar`

Or create sprites that better match your use case:

`videosprites process test/videos/GibraltarVotesToRemainBritish1967-51sec.mp4 tmp/gibraltar2 --seconds=5 --width=150 --columns=3 --group=6 --basename=filename`

You can also make an animated GIF from all the selected frames using the same size as the thumbnails by adding the `--gif` option.

### Use as Gem
To use the project as a module in your own video processing workflow you can use it like this:

```ruby
input_file = '/path/to/video.mp4'
output_directory = '/path/to/tmp/gibraltar2'
options = {
  seconds: 10,
  width: 160,
  columns: 4,
  group: 20,
  gif: false,
  keep_images: false,
  basename: 'filename' # Base filename for outputs. Optional; default is "sprites".
}
processor = VideoSprites::Processor.new(input_file, output_directory, options)
processor.process
```

## Players

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
